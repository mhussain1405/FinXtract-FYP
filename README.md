# FinXtract - Final Year Project
FinXtract is an AI-powered financial tool that automates data extraction from unstructured financial documents like PDFs, helping auditors and financial analysts save time, reduce manual effort and errors, and focus on analysis and decision-making instead of tedious data entry.

🔍 Key Features:

1. Automated data extraction from unstructured financial PDFs using OCR (PaddleOCR), NLP, and deep learning.
2. RAG-based Q&A chatbot (DeepSeek-R1) that lets users ask any finance related queries and get instant insights.
3. 95%+ extraction accuracy across diverse, multi-page financial reports, even with complex or inconsistent layouts.
4. Interactive frontend built with the MERN stack and connected to Flask-based APIs for seamless real-time use.
